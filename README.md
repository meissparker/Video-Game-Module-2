# Defeat the Evil Wizard

I modified the existing code to add 4 characters, a Paladin, an Archer, a Goblin and a Vampire. 
I gave each of the 6 total characters in the game 2 unique special abilities. Each of them can also attack and heal.
the object of the game is to defeat the evil wizard before he defeats you. The user can attack the wizard using
attacks or special abilities. Whoever runs out of health first. I think the game is fairly straightforward and easy to use.
